# Wordle Clone

This is a simple wordle clone that I used primarily as an experimentation platform for a few new (to me) technologies:
- wasm/wasm-bindgen/wasm-pack
- react functional components
- build.rs configuration (for compiling the dictionaries)
- css modules

The dictionary is statically included into the binary, and referenced in place.
